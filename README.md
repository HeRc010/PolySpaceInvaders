PolySpaceInvaders
=================

A clone of the arcade game space invaders using PolyCode

In order to run Polycode must be set up on the host machine. Assuming a working environment,
in order to run the game currently, move the folder containing the repository into the Template folder, within the
Framework folder in Polycode, open the VS project(I use VS 2012) and debug.
