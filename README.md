PolySpaceInvaders
=================

A clone of the arcade game space invaders using PolyCode

In order to run the clone, Polycode must be installed properly on the host machine. Assuming a working environment, to run the clone(at present) move the folder containing the repository into the Template folder, within the
Framework folder in Polycode, open the VS project(I use VS 2012) and debug.
